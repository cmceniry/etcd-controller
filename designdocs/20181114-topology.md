# 20181114 Topology

**DRAFT**

This describes the components involved in the etcd-controller.

# Components

There are two large component parts:

1. the portions rolled up into the `etcd-controller` binary
2. the portions which `etcd-controller` relies on out of binary

## Grouper (in binary)

The Grouper is a background piece which maintains the active group membership of the controller.
It does gossip discovery with the other controllers.

## Conductor (in binary)

The Conductor is the singleton actor which makes decisions for what actions to perform.

The Conductor is elected in a simple process.

## Driver (in binary)

The Driver is the per node actor which performs local etcd process operations: start, stop, disk cleanup, snapshot load, etc.
It listens for GRPC requests and follows up with actions.

## etcd (out of binary)

`etcd` is the upstream etcd process

## Official Member List

The Official Member List is a simple file which describes what nodes are supposed to be in the cluster.
It is considered the authoritative list, and the Conductor will work to make the actual list look like the official list.

This is expected to be maintained by an out of binary process.
The Conductor watches the OML to make decisions as to which nodes to add or remove.
The Grouper watches the OML to look for gossip adjustments to be made.
