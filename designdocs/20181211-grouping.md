# 20181211 Grouping

**DRAFT**

This describes the way the cluster membership is maintained and how the conductor is selected/reselected.

At this time, group doesn't try to be too smart.
The general approach is to favor Consistency.
In the event of a node failure or general partition, the conductor will stop (or not start) by itself.
It can be manually started by a command.

STEP 1:
- If manually set, do what's manually set
- If all cluster is present, start conductor on lowest node
- If not all cluster is present, don't do anything
- If 



Go strictly on nodelist contents?
- If I have quorum, pick the lowest one as conductor
- assumption is that the nodelist will eventually make it to what is what it should be

# Membership

## On Start Up

## On Node List Change

## 



# Conductor Selection

The conductor is the lowest member of the nodelist.

Lowest member is defined by `IPv4 (as int) << 16 + command port number`

## Normal Selection

If the controller cluster has all nodes from the node list (and only the nodes from the node list)


## Selection during Failure



Partition

## Manual Selection

An Operator can issue a command to tell a node to become the conductor.
It will indicate that in its memberlist metadata, and then 

When ready to resume operation, an Operator can issue another command to return to normal operations.
